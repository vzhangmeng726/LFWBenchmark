# LFWBenchmark



## LFWFaces

Detected LFW faces with boundingboxes and five facial points.

A matlab script for face alignment given five facial points. 

## CNNCaffeExtraction

A matlab script showed how to extract features for evaluation using [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe).

## CNN model
[2016-02-28] A [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0W0rPKOeIBydzgzRTZ1aktrN1k/view?usp=sharing) trained on [MS-Celeb-1M](https://github.com/wuyuebupt/MSCELEB1M-GenImage) is released, which has 99.52% accuracy on LFW.


## LFWROC

LFW evaluation code with PCA and cosine distance. 

Results on provided features:

| Name            | Accuracy    |
| --------------- | ----------- | 
| lfwfeatures.mat | 98.97       | 
| lfw_9953.mat    | 99.53       | 


## REF
Face alignment and caffe feature extraction codes are modified from [CenterFace] (https://github.com/ydwen/caffe-face).
